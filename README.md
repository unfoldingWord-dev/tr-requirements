translationRecorder Requirements
---
These are the requirements and specifications for translationRecorder. The
projects using these requirements are

TBD

##Format
The requirements are written in
[Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) so that they
can be ran through [Cucumber](https://cukes.info/). You can also read about
Gherkin at [Behat](http://docs.behat.org/en/latest/guides/1.gherkin.html).
The documentation there is a little cleaner.

##Purpose
These requirements provide a unified definition of features to be
implimented in tR. This allows for more reliable testing, better
collaboration, and helps to maintain focus on the long term goals of tR.

The practical application of these requirements will be in the establishment
of acceptance tests. We will potentially use
[PioneerJs](http://pioneerjs.com/) to run these tests.
